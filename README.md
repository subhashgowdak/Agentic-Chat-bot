# Agentic Chat Bot

A simple Python-based **retrieval‑augmented chatbot** built using **Ollama embeddings**, **Chroma vector store**, and a minimal terminal interface.

This repository demonstrates how to:

* Load and embed a dataset (CSV)
* Build a Chroma vector store
* Retrieve relevant documents for a user query
* Generate responses using an LLM from the Ollama ecosystem

This is a lightweight prototype suitable for learning, experimentation, and extending into your own agentic systems.
